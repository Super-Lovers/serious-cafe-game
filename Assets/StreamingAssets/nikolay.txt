Both me and my brother have anger issues...
But I have, over the years, managed mine...
Oh, Sorry, pass me a large coffee cup with lemon first.
I managed mine and reduced the stress
so currently I am very cool headed unless
it is something heinous. As extra info, at the time...
He was 22 and I was 19. So he and my mom...
they were arguing and it got heated so I got up...
I interviened. I got to them just in time to see...
my brother hit her and the red mist just came down.
I dragged him outside and he ended up bleeding on...
the floor with a broken nose, two black eyes, a...
split lip, a broken arm, a fractured rib...
and a severe concussion. I left him there.
I walked inside, called ambulance for him and...
convinced my mom to lie down and take a sleeping...
pill. When the ambulance arrived, I went with it...
and made sure he was taken care of. On the good...
side of this, we talked after and I convinced him
to go to anger management. We are quite close...
now and he has calmed down a bit.
